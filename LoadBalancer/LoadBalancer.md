Implement a prototype of a round-robin load-balancing algorithm.

There are n servers indexed from 1 to n, and m requests to be processed.
The ith request arrives at time arrival[i] and takes burstTime[i] time to execute.
The load balancer assigns the request to the available server with the minimum index.
A server that is assigned the ith request is unavailable from time arrival[i] to arrival[i] + burstTime[i]. At arrival[i] + burstTime[i],
the server is available to serve a new request.

Given n, arrival, and burstTime for each request, find the index of the server that executes it.
If no server is available at the time, the request is dropped, and -1 is reported.
If multiple requests arrive at the same time, the one with the smaller index is assigned first.

Example 
Suppose n = 3, m = 5, arrival = [2, 4, 1,8,9], and
burstTime = [7, 9, 2, 4, 5]

Output: [1, 2, -1, 1, 2]
