Lucy loves to play Hop, Skip and Jump game. Given an N*M matrix and starting from cell (1,1), her challenge is to hop in an anti-clockwise direction and skip alternate cells. The goal is to find out the last cell she would hop onto.

Write an algorithm to find the last cell Lucy would hop onto after movie anti-clockwise and skipping alternate cells.

Input:
The first line of input consists of two integers- matrix_row and matrix_col, representing the number of rows (N) and the number of columns(M) in the matrix, respectively. The next M line consist of N space-seprated integers representing the elements in each cell of the matrix.

Output:
Print an integer representing the last cell Lucy would hop onto after following the given instructions.

Example:

Input:
3 3
29 8 37
15 41 3
1 10 14

Output:
41

Explanation:
Lucy starts with 29, skips 15, hops onto 1, skip 10, hops onto 14, skips 3, hops onto 37, skips 8, and finally hops onto 41.
So, the output is 41 



Notes:
3 x 3 
Start at S1 and go counter clockwise and skip cells
