# Question
Ray likes puzzles. One day, he challenged Ansh with a puzzle to find a string that is the same when read forwards and backwards. Write an algorithm to find the substring from a given string that is the same when read forwards and backwards.

# Input
The input consists of a string-inputStr, representing the given string for the puzzle. 

# Output
From the given string, print a substring which is the same when read forwards and backwards.

# Note
If there are multiple sub-strings of equal length, choose the lexicographically smallest one. If there are multiple sub-strings of different lengths, choose the one with the maximum length. If there is no sub-string that is the same when read forwards and backwards, print "None". Sub-string is only valid if its length is more then 1. Strings only contain uppercase characters (A-Z).

# Examples
Example 1:
Input:
```
YABCCBAZ
``` 
Output:
```
ABCCBA
```
Explanation:
Given string is "YABCCBAZ", in this the only sub-string which is same when read forwards and backwards is "ABCCBA". So, the output is "ABCCBA".


Example 2:
Input:
```
ABC
```
Output:
```
None
```
Explanation:
Given string is "ABC", and no sub-string is present which is same when read forwards and backwards. So, the output is "None".
