Now that John and Jane know how to right words forwards and backwords, they want to see if they can find the vowels in a word.

John wants to write a function in JavaScript called 'findVowels' that takes in a string and returns the amount of vowels in the given string and the vowels found in the string.

Jane wants to write a function in Python called 'find_vowels' that takes in a string and returns the amount of vowels in the given string and the vowels found in the string.

Can you help them write their functions?

Example 1:
Input:

```
"Hello World"
```

Output:

```
Vowels found: 3
["e", "o", "o"]
```

Explanation:
Given string is "Hello World", in this the vowels are "e", "o", "o". So, the output is "Vowels found: 3" and ["e", "o", "o"].

Example 2:
Input:

```
"BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"
```

Output:

```
Vowels found: 0
[]
```

Explanation:
Given string is "BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ", and no vowels are present. So, the output is "Vowels found: 0" and [].
